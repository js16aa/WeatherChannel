### Project Description:
(This assignment taught me how to build an application using API.)

### View Project:
https://js16aa.github.io/WeatherChannel/

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (Parse JSON Data.)
2. (Ajax methods.)
3. (Apixu registration.)
4. (View HTTP Response.)
5. (How to create a visually appealing application.)

### Latest update:
As of now, the Apixu API is no longer available, so I updated the apixu_forecast.js file to make a HTTP request to Weather API instead. The only limitation of the Weather API is that the 7 day forecast feature is locked behind a paywall, so the current iteration of the project is limited to a 3 day forecast.
